bp = {"general":"If the spam problem is fixed as you believe it to be, then there should be no further complaints received. \
                In general, once all issues have been addressed (fixed), reputation recovery can take anywhere from a few hours to just over one week \
                to improve, depending on the specifics of the situation, and how much email volume the IP sends. Complaint ratios determine the amount \
                of risk for receiving mail from an IP, so logically, reputation improves as the ratio of legitimate mails increases with respect to the number of complaints.",

                "grey":"The discrepancy with the IP has been addressed and the reputation of the IP will improve within 24 hours.",

                "spamhaus":"Your IP has a poor Talos Intelligence Reputation due to currently being listed on Spamhaus (http://www.spamhaus.org/lookup). \
                Please contact Spamhaus directly to resolve this listing issue. Once delisted, the Talos Intelligence Reputation for the IP should improve within 24 hours.",

                "recovered":"Your IP currently has a Neutral Talos Intelligence Email Reputation (within acceptable parameters). The reputation should continue to \
                improve as we receive additional good mail volume reports for the IP from our sensor network.",

                "heloptr":" Your IP or IPs has a poor Talos Intelligence email reputation because the IP is helo-ing with a generic host name string. \
                This is a known behavior pattern with BOT infected systems. The IP should be HELO-ing as the sending domain and the PTR should also point \
                to the hosted domain for proper SMTP authentication; HELO should match PTR and sender domain should match Helo string. \
                Once this discrepancy is addressed, the reputation of the IP should improve over the course of a few days as our \
                system receives sensor data indicating a fix in helo/ptr match for the IP and to the sender domain.",

                "noscore":"Your IP or IPs has a neutral  Talos Intelligence reputation due to very low levels of mailflow traffic reported for the IP by the Talos Intelligence Network. \
                As such, without sufficient email reports, Talos Intelligence cannot accurately generate a reputation for the IP and therefore grants the IP a Neutral reputation. \
                Generally this is a very good thing as Talos Intelligence does not see the IP as a potential spam risk, and the IP is considered within acceptable Talos Intelligence parameters.  \
                Sometimes however, our customers will throttle or reject mail if there is no reported evidence of sufficient traffic. \
                We have no control over how passive or aggressive our customers choose to be when implementing our reputation information.In some cases, \
                Cisco customers who use Talos Intelligence reputation as part of their filtering infrastructure may forget to add this explanation to the report they \
                generate when rejecting the message. This may be the case here. I recommend contacting the recipient via other means and having them request to their sys-admin or \
                ISP provider to whitelist mail from your IP so that it makes it into their network. You may try to generate a reputation based on sufficient mail \
                traffic by gradually ramping up on good outbound mail. This may generate some increase in Talos Intelligence Network reports for your IP \
                and thus produce enough data for Talos Intelligence to generate an actual score.",

                "iadh":"Our worldwide sensor network indicates that spam originated from your IP. We suggest checking these possibilities to help isolate the \
                root cause of the spam and mail server access attempts originating from your IP. Audit your mailing list(s) to ensure you are NOT sending \
